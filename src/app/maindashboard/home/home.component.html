        <h2>Why Invest in Startups?</h2>
        <p>Investing in startups allows you to become part of high-growth companies at an early stage, where even small
          contributions can multiply significantly over time. Startups bring fresh ideas, disruptive technologies, and
          new market opportunities — giving investors the chance to support innovation while earning strong potential
          returns. Unlike traditional investments, startups offer equity ownership, meaning you directly benefit from
          their success. With the right vision, research, and timing, startup
          investing can transform your portfolio, your finances, and your future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h2>How to Reduce Risk?</h2>
        <p>Investing in startups can deliver high returns, but it also comes with significant risk. To make smarter
          decisions, investors should follow a structured approach. Start by diversifying your portfolio so your capital
          isn’t dependent on the success of a single startup. Always evaluate the founding team, validate the product’s
          real-world demand, and ensure the startup operates in a large, growing market. Reviewing financial health —
          including revenue model, burn rate, and runway — helps you understand long-term sustainability. Begin with
          smaller investments, rely on trusted and verified platforms, and make sure you understand key fundraising
          documents like term sheets and cap tables.</p>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h2>Long-Term Wealth</h2>
        <p>Long-term wealth is built through patience, consistency, and smart financial choices. Instead of chasing
          quick profits, it focuses on investments that grow steadily over time — compounding your returns and
          strengthening your financial foundation. By investing in promising startups early, you gain equity that can
          increase dramatically as the company scales. Combined with disciplined investing, diversification, and staying
          invested during market ups and downs, long-term wealth creates financial stability and future independence.
          It’s not just about earning money today — it’s about building a future where your investments work for you.
